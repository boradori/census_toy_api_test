# Census Toy API Test

Libraries: pytest, pytest-html, requests

In order to run this test, you will need to install **Python** and **pip** first. **pip** is
a **Python package manager** that allows you to install and manage software packages written in **Python**.

If you install **Python**, **pip** will also be automatically installed.

You should also use virtual environment for easier dependency management of your project. Please try to use the following command to create a virtual environment.
```commandline
python -m venv venv
or
python3 -m venv venv
```

Once you have created a virtual environment, you can activate it by using the following command.
```commandline
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you can activate the virtual environment by using the following command.
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
